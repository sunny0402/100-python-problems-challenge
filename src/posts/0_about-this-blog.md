No one said it would be this hard to become a developer.

I fell in love with programming when I saw this Python course on Udemy. It was a whole new world. Remeber that feeling? I also wanted to solve this problem at work which I couldn't with excel.

So long story short I left work. Tried to complete an engineering degree, no luck. And since have been teaching my self web development.

Time to finish this journey. To get there I need to get better at interview problems. An honestly, solving "Leetcode" style problems has helped me problem solve when building larger projects.
